The FusionPBX code is constantly evolving. Bug fixes being submitted, additions to improve security, making FusionPBX look nicer, to be more flexible, and best of all new features. A complete summary of the changes can be found on the github code page https://github.com/fusionpbx/fusionpbx/commits/master .  Initially google code svn was the place to download code from but since that has closed github is where the code now lives.
